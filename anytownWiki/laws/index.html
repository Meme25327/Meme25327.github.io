                <h2>The JIRP Test</h2>
                <p>
                    Every prospective resident must pass the JIRP test, which rates people on their likelihood to commit crimes and the outlandishness of said crimes. Prospective residents with too low a score will
                    not be guaranteed residence in Anytown.

                <p>
                    Anytown has comparatively lax tax laws. In order to be considered a citizen, a person must reside in the city for at least 91 days in a year. Once this threshold has been reached, the resident can
                    get Anytown's tax laws if they want them.
