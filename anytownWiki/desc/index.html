                    <p style = "font: 20px sans-serif;">
                        Unlike other towns in the state of Ohio, Anytown was not initially settled by indigenous people. It was created in 1803 (exact date unknown), for the purposes of the Ohio Bar Exam. A fake town was
                        required to set the questions in, so as to avoid any issues with similarities to other cases.

                        <br>
                        Since then, Anytown has become notorious for its crimes' outlandishness. Many of those crimes are actually murky when it comes to legality, and there's often no clear cut perpetrator in those cases<a href = "../blood_dimension.html" onclick= "bloodAlert()" style="text-decoration: none; color:rgb(138, 3, 3)">,</a>

                        <br>
                        After the Treaty of Greenville (1795), the Ohio Country was opened to European-American settlement. They were mostly farmers in the early years.

                        In 1886, an idea by a local printer gave rise to the specialty advertising industry, which, from its "birth" in Anytown, eventually developed into various manufacturing companies all over the
                        country. Today, four specialty advertising companies still thrive in Anytown.
