                    <p>
                        Defendant and his friends went to a local bar in Town, Ohio, to watch a
                        heavyweight title fight. The crowd at the bar was very loud and rowdy, in part because
                        they were drinking, and because everyone was anxious about the fight. While excitedly
                        cheering for the contender, Defendant accidentally bumped into one of the champion’s
                        fans, Fan, and knocked him down. Fan got up and punched Defendant in the face,
                        breaking Defendant’s nose. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Defendant and his friends immediately left the bar and went to Bully’s house.
                        Defendant and his friends told Bully what happened at the bar, and Bully became angry
                        about it. Bully decided to go down to the bar alone and “get” Fan for what Fan did to
                        Defendant. Bully thought that without Defendant accompanying him, Fan wouldn’t
                        suspect a reprisal. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Bully told Defendant and his friends he would sneak up on Fan and stab him in
                        the back, just to hurt him; all he needed Defendant to do was give him a knife and a
                        description of Fan. Everyone agreed to what Bully proposed, so Defendant handed Bully
                        a knife and joined his friends in giving Bully a description of Fan. Defendant and his
                        friends stayed at the house when Bully left to go find Fan.

                            Bully went into the bar just as the heavyweight fight was ending. He walked up
                            behind Victim, a man who Bully mistakenly believed was Fan. Bully stabbed Victim in the
                            back with the knife Defendant had given him and fled the bar. Shortly thereafter, Victim
                            died as a proximate cause of the knife wound. Bully immediately left town and has not
                            been seen since.

                            <br>
                            Defendant was arrested and charged with complicity in the premeditated murder
                            of Victim. Defendant’s friends were also arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit
                            the premeditated murder of Victim.
