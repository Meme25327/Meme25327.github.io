                    <p>
                        Late one evening in Anytown, Ohio, Robber ran up behind Lady and tried to snatch her purse. Lady resisted and, in an
                        effort to wrestle the purse from her, Robber struck Lady in the face with the flashlight he was carrying. When Lady fell
                        to the ground, she broke her arm, and Robber escaped with her purse.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Witness was walking in the same area and saw Robber strike Lady and run away with her purse. Instinctively, Witness
                        started to chase Robber down the street and yelled for help during the chase. Robber removed Lady’s cash and credit
                        cards before discarding the purse as he ran away.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Cop, an off-duty policeman who was out of uniform, responded to Witness’s call for help and joined in the chase for
                        Robber. As Robber turned a corner, he discarded his hoodie and his flashlight. Robber then saw Jogger, greeted him,
                        and told him that he was out for his evening run. Robber and Jogger talked a little and agreed to run together and enjoy
                        the exercise. Almost immediately thereafter, Witness and Cop turned the corner and spotted Robber and Jogger. Cop
                        yelled “Stop or I’ll shoot.” Because of Cop’s threat to shoot, Robber and Jogger began to run faster. Cop then fired three
                        warning shots into the air.

                        <div class = "centered">The broken window of Attorney's house.</div>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Robber took the lead and Jogger followed him up a path to the back of Attorney’s house. In an effort to evade their
                            pursuers, Jogger picked up a brick, broke a small window on the back door of Attorney’s house, and opened the door.
                            Jogger and Robber then entered the house and hid in Attorney’s home office. Cop and Witness were unable to locate
                            Robber and Jogger and soon gave up the search.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After a while, Robber and Jogger believed they had successfully evaded their pursuers and decided to leave the house.
                            On their way out, Robber noticed several valuables on Attorney’s office desk. Robber pocketed the valuables, and Jogger
                            also took several items of value and placed them into his own pockets. The two men then left Attorney’s house and went
                            their separate ways.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After being identified by witnesses from a surveillance film obtained from Attorney’s home, Robber and Jogger were
                            arrested and each was charged with (1) Aggravated Robbery of Lady, (2) Felonious Assault of Lady, (3) Criminal
                            Trespass, (4) Vandalism of Attorney’s home, and (5) Burglary of Attorney’s home.
