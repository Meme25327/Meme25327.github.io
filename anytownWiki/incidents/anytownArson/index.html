                    <p>
                        On a warm evening in Anytown, Ohio, Joe was home alone, sitting on the front porch of his house when
                        he heard a loud bang from behind his house. Joe got up and ran around the house to the back yard and found Adam
                        Arsonist (Adam) and his accomplice, Flame, throwing molotov cocktails into Joe’s detached garage. Adam was still
                        armed with a molotov cocktail and, when seeing Joe approach, turned to throw a firebomb at Joe’s house. Joe pulled
                        out his .44 Magnum and shot Adam in the chest. Joe then turned his attention to Flame and held him at gunpoint,
                        threatening to shoot him too if he didn’t get on the ground until the police arrived.

                        Because Joe's neighbor had called the police when Adam and Flame set Joe’s garage on fire, a plainclothes police officer
                        (Cop) was on the scene immediately and witnessed the shooting of Adam by Joe. With his gun drawn, Cop ordered
                        Joe to drop his .44 and get on the ground. In response, Joe told the approaching unidentified stranger (Cop) that he was
                        trespassing, ordered him to get off his property, and fired a warning shot from his .44 Magnum into the air to scare him
                        and let him know he meant business. Upon hearing and witnessing the warning shot, Cop took dead aim at Joe and
                        shot him in the chest, causing Joe to fall to the ground and drop his weapon. Joe was seriously injured from the gunshot
                        wound to his chest and was knocked unconscious.

                            Flame was so scared from what he had just witnessed, he picked up Joe’s gun, turned, and began to run away from the
                            scene. Cop gave chaseacross the back yard and shot at Flame several times. One shot fired by Cop hit Flame in the back
                            and dropped him, causing his eventual death.

                            Adam survived the shooting and was charged with arson of the garage and attempted arson of Joe’s house. Adam was
                            also charged with the aggravated murder of Flame. Joe was charged with the felonious assault of Adam and aggravated
                            menacing of Cop. Cop was charged with felonious assault of Joe and aggravated murder of Flame.
