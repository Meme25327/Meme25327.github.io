                    <p>
                        Dan owned a chicken wing restaraunt, Wing Hut, in Anytown, Ohio. After years of success, sales
                        declined after ABC Wings, another chicken wing restaraunt, opened across the street. Dan thought
                        his only hope was to shut down the competition. Dan decided he would set fire to ABC Wings one night
                        after it closed. Dan asked Amy, his girlfriend, to set fire to ABC Wings and she agreed. Dan's head
                        chef, Chris, overheard these plans. He worried that Wing Hut would have to close so he offered to help.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Dan asked Chris to look at the floor plans for ABC Wings to help identify the best place to set the fire.
                        Chris drew a map and directions to lead Amy to the perfect place to start the fire. Seeing an opportunity
                        to eliminate yet more competition, Dan asked his roommate Bob to set fire to XYZ Taco, another restaraunt
                        located next door to Wing Hut. Bob agreed to help.

                        <p>
                            Unbeknownst to Dan, however, Bob contacted the police and explained the plan. On the designated day, Dan
                            went to a gas station and bought 2 gallons of gas. One for Amy to use at ABC Wings, and one for Bob to use
                            at XYZ Taco. Amy and Dan waited Wing Hut until after midnight, when the restaraunts would close. Amy then
                            took the gas can across the street while Dan waited at Wing Hut. As Amy entered ABC Wings, Dan saw several
                            police cars suddenly arrive. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Dan called Amy on her cell phone and told her, "I changed my mind, you are on your own. I want nothing to do
                            with your plan." Moments later, police officers burst into both restaraunts and arrested Amy and Dan. Bob had
                            remained at home, not intending to go through with the plan. Amy, Chris, Dan, and Bob were all indicted in the
                            Anytown County Court of Common Pleas.
