                    <p>
                        One afternoon in suburban Anytown, Ohio, Mom was working in her home office when she saw on the
                        screen of her home security camera that a person took from her front porch a small package that was
                        just delivered. Believing the person was a thief (Thief) and had taken the book set that Mom ordered
                        for her 10-year-old daughter (Daughter), Mom grabbed a large stapler from her desk and ran outside
                        to stop Thief and retrieve the package. Mom ran up behind Thief and threw the stapler at him, hitting
                        him in the head, and knocking him to the ground. Mom retrieved the package, then she ran back into
                        her house, and called the police.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After mom got off the phone, she stood near her front door to wait inside for the police. Mom then
                        saw through the window that Daughter had just gotten off the school bus and was walking toward the
                        house. Fearing for the safety of Daughter because Thief was still outside lying on the ground, Mom
                        grabbed her pistol and went outside to escort Daughter into the house. Seeing Mom approach with her
                        gun pointed at him, Thief grabbed Daughter and threatened to take her in his car if Mom did not let
                        him flee the scene.
                        <div class = "centered">
                            <img src = "images/daughter_reenact.png" style="border: 2px solid black;">
                        </div>
                        <div class = "centered">Daughter re-enacting her fateful walk back home</div>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Mom continued pointing the gun at Thief and told him to take his hands off Daughter or she would
                            shoot him. Thief simply laughed and continued pulling Daughter toward his car and threatening to
                            take her with him if Mom did not put down the gun and let him leave. Afraid that Thief would follow
                            through on his threat, Mom aimed the gun and shot Thief in the leg. Thief fell to the ground and
                            Daughter was able to run into the house. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Mom then stood over injured Thief, pointing the gun directly at his head. As Thief was calling Mom
                            crazy and pleading for his life, Mom laughed and repeatedly threatened to shoot him in the head.
                            When the police arrived approximately 20 minutes later, they took Thief into custody. Although Thief
                            was charged criminally, he filed a civil tort action against Mom in an Ohio court.
